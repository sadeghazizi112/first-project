    <p>
      <div class="my-class">Some stuff about myself and what I'm trying to accomplish. I am a college student looking to study coding and multimedia.
        I <em>was</em> originally a Business Major, but I found that <strong>Coding and Multimedia</strong> would be much more useful down the line.
      So here I am!</div>
    </p>
    <h2><ins>Projects That I Made</ins></h1>
      <div class="my-class">
    <ul>
      <li><dl class="dl-horizontal"><a href="file:///C:/Users/Owner/AppData/Local/atom/app-1.30.0/hello-world.html">Hello World</a></li>
          <dd>This was my first webpage that I created using <strong>block elements</strong>. These are HTML elements that when displayed start on a line of their own, in effect making a "<em>block</em>" on the page. There are also <strong>< p ></strong> tags. These are the elements you put at the start an end of something when you want the text to be a paragraph.</dd>
          </dl>
      <li><dl class="dl-horizontal"><a href="file:///C:/Users/Owner/AppData/Local/atom/app-1.30.0/my-first-webpage.html">First Webpage</a></li>
          <dd>This is were I started practicing <strong>inline elements</strong>. That means things like the <strong>< h ></strong> and <strong>< strong ></strong> tags. That's heading and bolding respectively. Can't forget about the <strong>< a ></strong> tag, that's how we link things. There is <em>WAY</em> more than that, but lets move on for now, shall we?</dd>
      <li><dl class="dl-horizontal"><a href="file:///C:/Users/Owner/AppData/Local/atom/app-1.30.0/favorite-things.html">My Favorite Things</a></li>
          <dd>This was where I practiced using CSS, which stands for <strong>Cascading Style Sheet</strong>. Its basically where we make "rules" for certain kinds of text to follow. Such as "<em>if its h2, then its blue</em>" or "<em>if its a paragraph, then its in italics and size 12px.</em>"</dd>
        </dl>
          <li><dl class="dl-horizontal"><a href="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Desktop/paragraphs/index.html">Paragraphs</a></li>
          <dd>This was where I practiced with using <strong>Classes</strong>. That is where you make rules (<em>see above</em>) for entire types of text, or "classes". For an example, if you want every bold word in the HTML page to be colored red, in the css stylesheet, you create a rule stating that. The difference between this and the above lesson is that your styling entire classifications, not specifics.</dd>
      <li><dl class="dl-horizontal"><a href="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Desktop/walrus/walrus.html">Walrus</a></li>
          <dd>This was where I practiced how to use <strong>< float ></strong> tags. It uses the css stylesheets much like the previous lessons, but alls you to decide on what side of the page the text will align. img { float: left, center, right?; }</dd>
        </d>
      <li><dl class="dl-horizontal"><a href="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Desktop/digital-vs-analog/digital-vs-analog.html">Digital vs Analog</a></li>
          <dd>This was the part where I got to know what <strong>Nesting</strong> is. The indendations of bulletpoint lists are a example of nesting. They are tags within the jurisdiction of other, bigger tags.</dd>
        </d>
      <li><dl class="dl-horizontal"><a href="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Desktop/greenland-iceland/greenland-iceland.html">Greenland-Iceland</a></li>
          <dd>This was where I practiced how to alter nested tags. Choosing what is affected and what isn't. Specifically, alterations to text within one nest, will not affect text outside of it.</dd>
        </d>
      <li><dl class="dl-horizontal"><a href="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Desktop/my-first-week/my-first-week.html">My First Week</a></li>
          <dd>Here was wher I was after one week of class! Quite a set up from the first day huh? For this we got to learn what <strong>Blockquotes</strong> and <strong>Jumbotrons</strong> are.Don't worry, despite its name, Jumbotrons aren't anything scary. A Jumbotron is a large box that can help draw emphasis to certain areas of your site. They're often used at the top of the page. Meanwhile a Blockquote is simply that, a block of quotation, neatly formatted.</dd>

      <div class="my-class">I'm native to the Portland Metro Area, even though I was born in California. I am attending Portland Community College currently and working at Columbia Sportswear.
      My favorite hobby is writing, even though I'm still fairly new at it.</div>
